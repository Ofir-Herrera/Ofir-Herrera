## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a Data Scientist with a strong background in **mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning**.  
I enjoy working with data broadly — biological, experimental, or general datasets — and using computational tools to uncover structure, patterns, and insights.

My academic research focuses on **swarming bacteria** and statistical physics, but my interests span a wide range of data-driven challenges and analytical modeling tasks.

## 🧩 Interests & Work Areas  
- Deep learning for **image, signal, and general data analysis**  
- Machine learning pipelines and modeling  
- Statistical physics of **collective behavior**  
- Spatial statistics: correlations & **Radial Distribution Function (RDF)**  
- Classical data science: EDA, inference, hypothesis testing  
- Computer vision for scientific imaging  
- Turning noisy or complex data into clear insights 💡

## 🎓 M.Sc. Thesis  
### *A Statistical Physics View of Swarming Bacteria*  
Studying collective behavior in bacterial swarms using:  
- **Deep learning–based detection**  
- Spatial statistics (RDF, correlation structure)  
- Tools from statistical physics  

A research environment combining ML, mathematical reasoning, and real experimental data.
