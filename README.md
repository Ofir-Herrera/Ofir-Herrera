## 🔬 About Me  

I’m a Data Scientist with a strong background in **mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning**.  
I enjoy working with data in a broad sense — biological, experimental, or general datasets — and using computational tools to uncover structure, patterns, and meaningful insights.

My academic work focuses on **swarming bacteria** and statistical physics, but my interests span a wide range of data-driven domains.  
I love combining **ML, mathematical reasoning, and real data** to understand complex systems.

## 🧩 Love working on:

- Deep learning for image, signal, and general data analysis  
- Machine learning pipelines and modeling  
- Statistical physics of **collective behavior**  
- Spatial statistics: correlations & **Radial Distribution Function (RDF)**  
- Classical data science: EDA, inference, hypothesis testing  
- Computer vision for scientific imaging  
- Turning noisy or complex data into clear insights 💡

## 🎓 M.Sc. Thesis  
### *A Statistical Physics View of Swarming Bacteria*  

Focused on understanding collective behavior in bacterial swarms using:

- **Deep learning–based detection**  
- Spatial statistics (RDF, correlation structure)  
- Mathematical and statistical modeling  

A research environment combining machine learning, statistical physics, and real experimental data.
