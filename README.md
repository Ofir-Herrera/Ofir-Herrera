👋 I'm Ofir — Data Scientist & Biophysicist  
M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics · Data Science · Bar-Ilan University  
Exploring how math, data, and machine learning connect 🧬📊

🚀 About Me  
I’m a Data Scientist with a strong background in **mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning**.  
I enjoy working with data broadly — whether biological, experimental, or general datasets — and using computational tools to uncover structure, patterns, and meaningful insights.

🧩 Interests & Work Areas  
- Deep learning for **image, signal, and general data analysis**  
- Machine learning pipelines and modeling  
- Statistical physics of **collective behavior**  
- Spatial statistics: correlations & **Radial Distribution Function (RDF)**  
- Classical data science: EDA, inference, hypothesis testing  
- Computer vision for scientific imaging  
- Turning complex or noisy data into clear, actionable insights 💡

🎓 M.Sc. Thesis — *A Statistical Physics View of Swarming Bacteria*  
Studying collective behavior in bacterial swarms using  
**deep learning–based detection**, spatial statistics, and tools from statistical physics.  
A research setting that brings together ML, mathematical reasoning, and real experimental data.
